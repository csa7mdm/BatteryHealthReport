# EV Battery Health Analysis System

A Python module for analyzing electric vehicle battery health from diagnostic data, designed for automotive dealerships and marketplace platforms.

## Overview

This system processes raw vehicle diagnostic data to generate comprehensive battery health reports, helping dealerships and buyers make informed decisions about EV condition and pricing.

## Features

- **State of Health (SoH) Calculation**: Industry-standard capacity-based health scoring
- **Charge Cycle Tracking**: Accurate cycle counting using partial cycle accumulation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of voltage imbalance, overheating, and degradation issues
- **Confidence Scoring**: Data quality assessment for report reliability
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Scalable design considerations for enterprise deployment

## Quick Start

```python
from battery_health_analyzer import BatteryHealthAnalyzer, create_mock_diagnostic_data

# Create analyzer instance
analyzer = BatteryHealthAnalyzer()

# Generate or load diagnostic data
diagnostic_data = create_mock_diagnostic_data()

# Analyze battery health
report = analyzer.analyze_battery_health(diagnostic_data)

print(f"Battery Health: {report.state_of_health_percent}%")
print(f"Charge Cycles: {report.charge_cycle_count}")
print(f"Anomalies: {len(report.anomalies)}")
```

## Technical Details

### Data Schema

The system expects diagnostic data in the following structure:

```python
@dataclass
class VehicleDiagnosticData:
    vehicle_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    battery_pack_voltage: float
    total_capacity_kwh: float
    current_capacity_kwh: float
    cells: List[BatteryCell]
    charge_history: List[ChargeEvent]
    odometer_miles: int
    manufacturing_date: datetime
```

### Calculation Methods

#### State of Health (SoH)
```
SoH = (Current Usable Capacity / Original Capacity) × 100%
```

Industry benchmarks:
- **>90%**: Excellent condition
- **80-90%**: Good condition  
- **70-80%**: Fair condition
- **<70%**: Poor condition

#### Charge Cycle Counting
Uses industry-standard partial cycle accumulation:
- Full cycle = 100% discharge + 100% charge
- Two 50% discharge cycles = One full cycle
- Accounts for partial charging patterns

#### Anomaly Detection Thresholds
- **Voltage Imbalance**: >50mV difference between cells
- **Cell Overheating**: >45°C operating temperature
- **High Resistance**: >5mΩ internal resistance
- **Rapid Degradation**: >8% capacity loss per year

### Confidence Scoring

The system provides a confidence score (0-100%) based on:
- Number of charge cycles available for analysis
- Completeness of cell monitoring data
- Vehicle age (newer vehicles have less reliable degradation estimates)
- Data consistency and quality

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for reports, InfluxDB for time-series cell data
- **API Layer**: FastAPI with async processing for real-time analysis
- **Message Queues**: Redis/Celery for background processing
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced anomaly detection and degradation prediction models
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and alerting for critical battery issues

See `production_considerations.md` for detailed architecture recommendations.

## Industry Context

This implementation is based on:
- IEEE standards for battery health assessment
- Real-world Tesla, BMW, and Nissan degradation patterns
- Automotive industry best practices for EV diagnostics
- CARFAX and similar vehicle history reporting standards
